This Meteor project supports the following:

1. Upload an image
2. Convert the image into several different standard sizes and qualities
3. Store the image in the local filesystem

This will store resized versions of the uploaded
images into the original, normal, small, tiny subdirectories within the .meteor/local/cfs/files/ directory.

To do: Publish these profile pics efficiently.
