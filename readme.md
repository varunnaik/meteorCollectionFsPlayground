This Meteor component supports the following:

1. Upload an image
2. Convert the image into several different standard sizes and qualities
3. Store the image efficiently in MongoDb

This will create a directory in your home directory, profile-pics and store resized versions of the uploaded
images into the original, normal, small, tiny subdirectories within that directory.
